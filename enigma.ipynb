It allowed the German military to communicate securely and secretly. Although the Enigma machine was considered unbreakable during the war, the British managed to crack the code, playing a crucial role in the Allied victory.\n",

They managed to decrypt it until the early 1940s when Germany changed the encryption methods and invaded Poland. Before the invasion, the Polish shared their knowledge of the Enigma with the British. The British then built the Bombe machine to break the new Enigma code.\n",

    "But how was the Enigma code broken? Here are the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enigma machine was originally a commercial product, used by many people. The Germans, however, used a more complex version of the machine. Nevertheless, many, including the Polish, knew how it worked and how it was built. So, contrary to popular belief, the Enigma machine was not a secret.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Enigma machine was configured differently for each day, which made code-breaking more difficult. However, through espionage and other methods, the Allies managed to obtain the daily configurations. This marked the starting point of the code-breaking efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hitler accounted for many things, but he often overlooked the human factor. Enigma operators, for instance, would frequently reuse configurations and send the same messages over and over, without much caution. This lack of care played a significant role in helping the codebreakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical flaw of the Enigma machine was that it never encrypted a letter as itself. This became a crucial point in breaking the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point for cracking the system was the word “Wetterbericht” (meaning “weather report” in German). The weather report was sent every day at the same time. This predictable pattern provided an essential clue for the codebreakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the codebreakers had two key pieces of information: the expected word “Wetter” and the knowledge that its encrypted version could not contain any repetition like \"..XX..\" (where \"X\" is any letter, and \".\" is any other letter). Using this, they began brute-forcing the system, focusing on finding the word “Wetter” within the encrypted messages."
